# Stack

+ Stack is a **LIFO** (Last In First Out) data structure i.e., the element that was inserted last will be removed first.
+ A stack is a **linear data structure** that provides two **O(1)** time operations: adding an element to the top, and removing an element from the top. It is only possible to access the top element of a stack.

# Applications of Stack in Programming
- We use text/image editor for editing the text/image where we have options to **redo/undo** the editing done. When we click on the redo /undo icon, the most recent editing is redone/undone. In this scenario, the system uses a stack to keep track of changes made.
- While browsing the web, we move from one web page to another by accessing links between them. In order to go back to the last visited web page, we may use the back button on the browser. We may go to a previously visited web page by using the BACK button of the browser. In this case, the **history of browsed pages is
maintained as stack**.
