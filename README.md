# Stack

+ Stack is a **LIFO** (Last In First Out) data structure i.e., the element that was inserted last will be removed first.
+ A stack is a **linear data structure** that provides two **O(1)** time operations: adding an element to the top, and removing an element from the top. It is only possible to access the top element of a stack.
